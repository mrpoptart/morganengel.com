Over the river and through the woods to Grandma Gale and Grandpa Richard!

The trip read mostly uneventful, though Malcolm thought it would be fun to extra poop at one of our stops resulting in 4 diapers and a new outfit, hooray<!-- more -->. No changing table in the men's room meant that mom got to handle all of that business. Thanks truck stop. You had a tiny movie theater, but no bathroom equality.

One we arrived there were of course, lots of hugs! Charlie was very good with the dogs, though he's still scared of dog kisses and Chelsea was a bit too nervous to play. He got lots of books read to him and we all had a lovely dinner.

After naptime we went to a trampoline place that was super fun! Morgan, Elizabeth and Gale all jumped with Charlie. We even went in the foam pit, which was a lot easier to get into than out of.

The next day we went to the park, the library, and had a mini nap. Then we swam in the hotel pool which was really fun! Malcolm wasn't too sure about it, but Charlie never wanted to get out.

After another nap we went back to the grandparents' place for dinner and a mini celebration die for Charlie's upcoming birthday. 2 days until he's 2! Hard to believe he was ever as small add Malcolm.
