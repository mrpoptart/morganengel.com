... And it's a doozy! 4 states in 2 weeks.  We are starting from home heading to Nevada and New  Mexico, then over to Arizona, and back to California to hit 29 palms and Orange County.  So far our little guys are being troopers<!-- more -->.

Charlie has been playing with cars,  coloring, singing,  looking at books and learning sign language.  (he can recognize all the letters of the alphabet now, and can make a few too!)  Mac has been mostly  eating and sleeping with a few awake breaks to look around and gurgle.

The "grownups"  have been playing roadtrip games with Morgan so far in the lead.

We are taking it easy stopping very often to stretch little legs and feed  little tummies.

Group morale is high,  no dysentery predicted.
