Last Monday we decided to try to make the trip to Panama on our own. We had heard that the prices were much lower than in Costa Rica, and we thought we’d do some souveniring and maybe pick up<!-- more --> a guitar to play. We got up at the crack of noon and began the bumpy trek toward the southern border of Costa Rica an hour away according to the GPS. On the way, we saw egrets, white birds with long S-shaped necks. They like to hang out in the fields we drive by on the way out of Zancudo. We also passed by some random free horses that I would have totally fed apples to but Morgan was all, “You can feed them when they’re on your side,” but we haven’t passed by ANY horses on my side since then and we’ve eaten all but the last apple.
