The first stop after arriving in the beautiful rural town of Torch Lake, Michigan was the rehearsal dinner. We freshened up at the cabin, then Matt and Alyson's family and friends all gathered at a local resort to meet each other, hang out, and in general<!-- more --> make merry.

The dinner was held under a huge gazebo in the middle of a big field, and Charlie and Jackson were so happy to be able to run around and get into a little trouble in the sunshine. There was a fire pit a ways off in the distance of the field and, of course, it was the only thing either of the boys wanted to play with. A few sooty hands later and we all enjoyed some amazing catering from one of the local area's up and coming chefs. There was brisket so tender you didn't need a knife, amazing cheesy potato deliciousness, a bunch of other tasty treats, beer, wine, and more, and eventually we also had a cake with a robot on the top of it.
