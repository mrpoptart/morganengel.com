The last two days have been all about relaxing, which means they’re not so much about things that we’d usually blog about. Most of our experiences that we want to share are about exciting adventures, danger lurking around occasional corners, interesting places, neat animals with horrible<!-- more --> stomach ulcers, and the like. Because of that, we’re just going to post random pics from the trip that we like and give a feel for the time we had here in general.
