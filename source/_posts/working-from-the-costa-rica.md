Tomorrow, I begin my week of work in Costa Rica. I still feel like I planned this whole thing pretty well. By working this first week then having the next two weeks to vacation, we’ll be able to get a good feel for the area, learn about it first, and then go do the things we want to do with few repercussions<!-- more -->.

It’s really nice to have a job that lets me do this and I sometimes forget just how good I’ve got it. I tested out the limits of the Internet connection here tonight and I think it’ll work fine. This is also an excellent way to test the software I write to ensure it works even with slow, spotty connections. So far, everything looks stellar, a testament to the quality of my team and what they build.

Here’s hoping that my presentation tomorrow goes off without a hitch and that the slightly slower net speed won’t be noticeable.
