Saturday was a day of hanging out, napping, and more napping. There were dozens of monkeys hopping through the trees at around 7 or 8 am. We didn’t get any pictures, but we sat on the porch and watched them try to get at the green bananas in the trees close to our house<!-- more -->. Lots of sounds early in the morning! All kinds of birds, frogs and of course the monkeys. We are told there are some crocs in the lake next to us, but we haven’t seen any yet on our walks. We are right across the street from the beach. It’s really beautiful. We will get more pictures there and probably have a picnic there at some point.
