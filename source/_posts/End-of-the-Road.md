Here we are camped out in our last hotel, right next to the airport. I can’t believe its almost over ! :c  we are having a quick bottle of humid foreign extra, just before we go down to dinner. Did you know... in one week exactly, fiancé heads to Costa Rica?? Is for work, but he can’t do that until after we go down to LA for a job together<!-- more -->. (And my engagement ring) maybe I can get him to blog about it. I wish I could go along too! Looking forward to seeing all my friends and family down south, and up north! Wish us a safe uncramped flight back!

Passepartout out!
