On our way home in the car, the headlights show the way in front of us and this excites the frogs who have been waiting to be able to see well enough to hop across the road. In addition to producing swerving while we’re on the highway, it also happens in front of our house, which causes me to say, “Hey look, a frog!” To which Morgan replies<!-- more -->, “Want me to catch it?”

This is one of those moments you never really plan for. “Uh.. YEAH!”

So little did I know that Morgan is apparently really good at catching frogs. He stepped out of the car, bent down and picked up a pretty decent sized toad. I thought he was cute.
