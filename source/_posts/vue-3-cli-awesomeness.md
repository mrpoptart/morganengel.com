How cool is it that I can just type
```shell
vue create newproject
cd newproject
vue use pug
vue use element-plus
```
and I have a working vue 3 system, complete with pug<!-- more -->, fully integrated with webpack and a UI component library that's ready for development? There's a few minor tweaks needed like setting `template="pug"` on the templates, but the setup couldn't be easier. So neat. If I could have just a couple more things like vue add firebase or some other sort of auth system, I'd be all set.

Hackathons, here I come.
