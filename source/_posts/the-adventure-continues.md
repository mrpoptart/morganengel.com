We got through security support fast and easy.. didn’t even have to take our shoes off, but then! Customs! I got through okay, but they room Morgan into the room with the mirrored doors.   “To pay a duty tax” hope its not a booty tax! Haha. But, actually<!-- more -->, I do hope we make our flight. The last lady out here had  been waiting for her man for 25 min!

... well it all worked out okay .. Morgan came out and then we went through another round of security. And now we are finally waiting for our flight. Watching a baby lick the window in front of us. Phew! See you soon!
