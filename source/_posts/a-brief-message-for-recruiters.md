I'm very selective with writing back or paying attention to recruiting messages. I believe finding a job is similar to dating, and that we should have compatibility before it's worth moving forward. Here's a few things you might want to know before writing<!--more-->:

* I have a passion for personal finance
* I'm looking to continue to grow as a manager 
* I have 20 years of SWE experience 
* I've been a manager of 2-3 teams of 6-12 engineers for 4+ years 
* I've started 3 businesses with varying levels of success 

### Here's what I'm looking for in a role:

* Opportunity to grow. I'm looking to reach the next level.
* A product role. I've spent more than a decade working with product teams and I find value in it.
* A reasonable amount of politics. I can play the game, but the product means more.
* A few hats. If you're expecting me to do 5 jobs well, nobody's going to be happy with the outcome.
* A company with heart. Startups do what they have to in order to survive, but they should have an eye towards being better.

* There's no wrong place to write me. As long as you're writing about something you sincerely think I'd be interested in, I'll write back if even to say no thank you.
