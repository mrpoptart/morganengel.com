This is a take on a pie that was inspired by a trip to a local brunch spot that put basil and strawberries on french toast and my life has never been the same. I've always imagined basil and savory to match, but the sweet citrus and basil herbal match so nicely<!-- more -->.

## Ingredients:
* 2 pounds fresh strawberries
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
* 2 tbsp. fresh green basil, minced
* 6 tbsp. corn starch

## Directions:
* Wash the strawberries, then remove the hulls.
* Leave very small strawberries whole, cut larger ones in half or quarters.
* Add the prepared berries to a bowl with the 1/2 cup sugar, the lemon juice, minced basil and fold gently to coat all the berries with the sugar.
* Leave the berries, covered at room temperature for about an hour, stirring occasionally; this will draw out liquid from the strawberries which is then thickened to ensure that the pie will hold together.
* Pour off most of the liquid from the bowl.
* Whisk in the cornstarch to the liquid until well combined.
* Place filling into pie crust — I recommend the Vodka Pie Crust Recipe.
* Bake at 375° until pastry is deep golden (cover edges of crust with foil if browning too quickly), 60–70 minutes. Set pie aside to cool for several hours before serving.
