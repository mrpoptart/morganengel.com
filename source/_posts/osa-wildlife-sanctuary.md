We woke up early this morning because we had a tour of the Osa Wildlife Sanctuary scheduled for 9am and the boat would take 45 minutes to get there. We couldn’t drive because apparently, there’s no road, so boat was the only option. Apparently the usual person to make this trip is<!-- more --> gone for the month of October, so we talked to Nelson, the waiter in the bar who agreed to take us on somebody else’s boat for a reasonable price. We ate our tuna fish sandwiches (might have cooked something but we ran out of propane last night and nobody has any for sale), and headed out to the dock, which was less of a “dock” per-se, and more of somebody’s backyard who happens to also have a dock in said backyard.
