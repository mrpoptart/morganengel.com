Some recipes are too good not to share. My family complains when I don't make potatoes this way<!-- more -->.

* 2 cups water
* 2 lbs Yukon gold potatoes
* 1 stick butter
* 3 sprigs rosemary
* Salt & pepper to taste

Add 2C water to the instant pot.

Pressure cook the potatoes on high for 7 minutes.

While doing a natural release, over medium high heat, melt the butter and add the rosemary to a large frying pan.

Add the potatoes and use a flat bottomed bowl or cup to smash the potatoes to half their height

Fry on one side until dark

Optional: baste the potatoes with the rosemary butter

Season with salt and pepper

serve warm
