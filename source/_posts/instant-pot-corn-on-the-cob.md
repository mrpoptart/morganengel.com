You're not going to believe me that this is the best corn you've ever had. You're not going to believe me that it's good because it's so easy. Despite all of those misgivings, you should still try it because it's the best corn and it's worth trying<!-- more -->.

* 1C water
* 6 ears corn
* Trivet

Put the trivet in the pot. Put the corn on the trivet. Add the water to the pot. Pressure cook on high for 5 minutes.

You can do a quick release if you want.

Add butter and salt if you want.

Eat more corn!
