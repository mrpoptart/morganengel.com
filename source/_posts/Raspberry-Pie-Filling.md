Nothing more special than a raspberry pie, except maybe for a strawbertry basil pie, but then, some people think that's weird<!-- more -->. 

## Ingredients:
* 1 cup sugar
* 3–4 tbsp. flour
* Pinch salt
* 5 cups fresh or thawed raspberries, stemmed
* 2 tbsp. butter, cut into small pieces

## Directions:
* Combine sugar, flour, and salt in a large bowl.
* Add raspberries and gently toss until well coated.
* Place filling into pie crust — I recommend the Vodka Pie Crust Recipe.
* Bake at 375° until pastry is deep golden (cover edges of crust with foil if browning too quickly), 60–70 minutes.
* Set pie aside to cool for several hours before serving.
