When I was about 15 years old, I woke up and decided that I should definitely go to Ireland. I’m not sure why or what sparked it, but all the research I’ve done since has only solidified the feeling. I like history (and historic romance novels.. shh!), I love green, and nature, and overcast days, and rain<!-- more -->.. I hear the people are friendly and down to earth. It sounds like the place for me!

So, almost 15 years later, here we are with two plane tickets.. We being the boyfriend (Phileas Fogg to my Passepartout), and I.

Phileas got a work bonus, and decided that we should go with the extra money.

So here I am, plotting and planning. Silly Phileas thought a blog would be a fun way to document.

I have 2 weeks left to plan our 2 week adventure!

So far, we have:
A tour of Guinness
Horseback riding
a stay in a castle
The Giants Causeway
and a whole slew of parks and ruins as we make a circle around the island.

I’m super excited, and here’s hoping I don’t leave the lamp on when we leave!
