I've been in tech for more than 20 years, and I've seen any variety of techniques trying to get me to interview with companies. Ultimately I want to know that I was chosen based on understanding who I am, not what metrics you know about me. If you want an easy interview with me, there's 3 things<!-- more --> you have to do:

1. Understand and mention my background. I was a full stack engineer for a long time and now I'm an engineering manager. Your role should fit my skills well. If you're looking for an iOS engineer, I'm not your huckleberry.
2. I have a deep passion for personal finance. If your role doesn't have anything to do with fintech, it's likely that I'm not interested, but if you still want to talk to me, you should call that out. 
3. I'm looking for a role with amazing people. Explain who I'd be working with and why they need management. If you don't know what your managers do, or you can't ask someone who does, it'll be tougher to get my interest. 
4. Bonus mention that you read this and did your best.
