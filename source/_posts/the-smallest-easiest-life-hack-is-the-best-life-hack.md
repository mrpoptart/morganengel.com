I’m a sucker for life hacks that save time and effort, and I consider this one of the easiest to implement.

When I use the microwave, I prioritize my button presses based on<!-- more -->

* Number of Buttons Pressed
* Number of Different buttons pressed

An example:
My microwave has an “Add 30 Seconds” button, regular numbers, and requires you to hit start before cooking.
I often want to cook food in multiples of 30 seconds.
Here’s a breakdown of some options from worst to best:

### 30 Seconds:

Add 30 Seconds, Start
* 3, 3, Start
* 3, 0, Start 

### 1 Minute:

Add 30 Seconds, Add 30 Seconds, Start
* 5, 5, Start
* 6, 0, Start

### 1 Minute 30 Seconds:

* 8, 8, Start
* Add 30 Seconds, Add 30 Seconds, Add 30 Seconds, Start
* 1, 3, 0, Start
* 
Ultimately this saves me no time at all during the day. What does happen is I use math to figure out what to press, which is better than it was before.

I know that 88 seconds is not the same as 90 seconds, but it’s close enough for me.
