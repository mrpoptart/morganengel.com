Today we had our 20ish week ultrasound. Everything looked great: two arms, two legs, brain, face and heart. All there and working as expected. All we need now is a middle name.

Current options include<!-- more -->: Tiberius, Sebastian, Oliver, and Maximus-Julius-Valhalla.

The baby is kicking like crazy, Especially when Elizabeth bends in half or eats sugar...

In related news, Charlie grew 3/4" in the last 3 weeks. This might explain his sudden fever, lethargy, and lack of appetite. On the bright side he is feeling better now.
