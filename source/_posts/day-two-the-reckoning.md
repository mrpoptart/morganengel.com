The feeling is intoxicating. The knowledge that even though your day is packed and that you’ve spent 1:20 sleeping through the course of it, you have at least an extra 4 hours in the day when everyone else is asleep. It’s not that I get to be alone, it’s that I now have time to do things, or at least<!-- more --> to dream about doing things during the hours that used to be filled with sleep.

I’ve slept 6.5 hours in the last two days, which is a good ratio compared to my usual 16 hours/48 hours. It’s not a full Uberman cycle yet, but I’m hopeful that after a few days of this, my naps will solidify and stop being so difficult.

Napping has become a bit of a chore the last few days. I feel tired, but when I lie down at work, especially in the morning, I just end up thinking about things instead of sleeping. I drift on the edge of sleep, feeling like I’m trying to catch a waterfall. When I grip too hard, I lose it and end up having to relax all over again.

I don’t know if this is because I’m just not dead tired like a normal acclimation or because I’ve changed in the last 2 years. I still can nap when I’m tired, and the main sleep I’ve been doing in the evenings/early mornings hasn’t been affected. I just feel like without the insane pressure of two days of no real sleep that the naps are harder. I know I need to have faith and that it takes 3 weeks to set a pattern in the brain, but for now, it’s hard to remember that the quiet time I spend almost sleeping is better than giving up.

Here’s to persistence.
