Travel planning can be stressful! I’ve taken on the responsibility of putting this trip together, since it was my idea in the first place. Phileas is along for the ride so to speak. But there are SO MANY OPTIONS! I don’t want to miss out on anything<!-- more -->!

But.. remembering back to previous trips, I’m happy to have done all of them. I wouldn’t trade even the more harrowing moments for anything.

So, I need to remember to relax when planning this one.. even though I want it to be the best trip ever, stressing isn’t really the way to achieve it. Every detail doesn’t have to be “right” to make it a great trip. Sometimes it’s the things we don’t plan for, that turn out the most worthwhile..

With a deep breath and a break from scouring the internets for everythingtopossiblydoeverwhileonatriptoIreland, I present you with My travels!

Looks like I’ve done a lot more traveling in the last year than I remembered. Not all of it for happy reasons, but all worthwhile.

I am looking forward to a family reunion with for my Tia’s 65th bday in the Dominican republic.

Well, back to cold pizza and planning!
