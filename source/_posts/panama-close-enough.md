Well, after our last experience, we decided to try Panama again with our neighbors who go every once in a while themselves. We figured that they would know how to deal with the cars and paperwork issues. Turns out, they don’t go IN to Panama, they just park their car, and go into<!-- more --> a mall that is on the border. So… We didn’t go to Panama-Panama, but we did go into some stores that were technically on Panama soil? We saw magnets with the word Panama on them at least. I am a little bit disappointed that we didn’t get a new stamp for the passports, but also, pretty glad we didn’t have to deal with any miscommunication over papers that left us stranded in another country.
